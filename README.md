<h2 align="center"> Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using PyTorch for emotion classification in Vietnamese text </h2>



**Objective**:
 This assignment aims to apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using PyTorch for emotion
 classification in Vietnamese text. Students will learn to preprocess text data, build an RNN
 model, train it on a labeled dataset, and evaluate its performance in predicting emotions
 associated with different sentences in Vietnamese.
